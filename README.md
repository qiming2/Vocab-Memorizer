## How to use this
Following the prompt

### Storing word-meaning pair into the path you provide
- Type File name (You want to store words in this file): ...
- Type Word: ...
- Type meaning: ...
(This would generate a word-meaning pair in the back and stored in the local path where you can define
at the main function)
### After finishing storing words, there are several options you can choose:
- Clear: clear unreviewed words in the cache list (Use this if you want to start a new review path)
- Review: (With this command, the words that users have made mistakes would be automatically added to the cache list for review,
          this command would only add the words that users desire to review into the cache list but would not erase previous words in the
          cache list! If you want a fresh reviewing list, you should do clear command)
  - Continue reviewing the words in the cache list
  - Last list of words stored in the path plus the words we have made mistakes
